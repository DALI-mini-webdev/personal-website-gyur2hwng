        <h1>Hi, I'm Gyuri!</h1>
        <p> I'm a '23 at Dartmouth majoring in Computer Science and trying to choose between
        Music or Human Centered Design minor. On campus, I'm involved in Women in
        Computer Science as an exec and Dartmouth College Wind Ensemble as a flutist. I often 
        participate in flute projects as well, which is currently recording the Chaminade 
        Flute Concerto Op. 107. I'm also a TA for CS10 this term.<br><br>

        I lived in Japan and China for four years each when I was little, but
        afterwards grew up in Seoul, South Korea and came to New Hampshire
        to go to Dartmouth! Currently I'm back at my home in Seoul. <br><br>

        Fun fact about me: my fingers are doublejointed!! <br><br>
